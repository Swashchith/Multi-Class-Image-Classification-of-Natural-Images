# Multi-Class-Image-Classification-of-Natural-Images
### Computer Vision is a hot topic and lately becoming an important part of the world. The multi-class image classification is a process where images are classified into different classes using the visual content and the pattern of the images. This is very important in the context of todayâ€™s world as databases with a large number of images are becoming common. In any field such as e-commerce, smart cities, and military, etcetera, the identification of images is significantly important. In this research, the multi-class image classification of natural images is done by implementing various deep learning techniques like Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), pre-trained transfer learning models like DenseNet121, InceptionResNetV2, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, VGG16, and the performance is discussed with the comparison. The research found that InceptionResNetV2 has the best performance with 99.71% accuracy whereas CNN has the least accuracy of 71.7% and all the models are evaluated plotting confusion matrix and classification report. This shows that transfer learning models perform significantly better than CNN and justifies the reason to use pre-trained models.
